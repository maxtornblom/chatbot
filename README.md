# Chatbot README
This repository contains a chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a neural network to converse with users. 
It is built using the following libraries: `nltk`, `tflearn`, `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `json`, and `pickle` libraries.

# Requirements
To run this code, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer along with the libraries mentioned above. You can install the required libraries by running the following commands:

```
pip install nltk   
pip install tensorflow
pip install tflearn
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
```

# Getting Started
The `intents.json` file contains the patterns and responses for the chatbot. This file can be customized to add more intents, patterns, and responses. The `data.pickle` file contains the tokenized words, labels, training data, and output data.

Run the following command to train the chatbot:

```
python train.py 
```
Once the model is trained, you can run the chatbot using the following command:

```
python main.py 
```
This will start a conversation with the chatbot in the terminal. You can type "quit" to exit the chatbot.

File Description
* `train.py`: Contains the code for training the chatbot.
* `main.py`: Contains the code for running the chatbot.
* `intents.json`: Contains the intents, patterns, and responses for the chatbot.
* `data.pickle`: Contains the tokenized words, labels, training data, and output data for the chatbot.

# How it works
The chatbot uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand user input and generate responses. When a user enters a message, the chatbot tokenizes the message and creates a bag of words, which is a vector representation of the words in the message.
The chatbot then uses a trained neural network to predict the appropriate response to the user's message. The neural network is trained on a dataset of patterns and responses, where each pattern is associated with one or more responses. During training, the neural network learns to associate patterns with the appropriate responses.
To predict the response to the user's message, the chatbot feeds the bag of words into the neural network and generates a probability distribution over the possible responses. The chatbot selects the response with the highest probability and returns it to the user.
In addition to generating responses, the chatbot may also be designed to perform additional tasks, such as retrieving information from a database or performing calculations. In these cases, the chatbot uses additional algorithms and techniques to process the user's request and generate an appropriate response.
